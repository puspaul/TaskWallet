# TaskWallet
Task tracker to keep your life organized.

I've decided to create a task tracker to keep my life organized, but knowing me, I'll probably spend more time tinkering with the colors and fonts than actually completing any tasks.



## Functionalities
1. Adding categories which would take care of different cohorts
2. In each section we could add tasks.
3. Each task would automatically take the entry date in its date section.
4. There would be a calendar popup in which we could add a deadline date if we wish to.
5. Prioritization bar - sort of like the bookmark bar in which we can move things up and down to indicate its prioritization.
